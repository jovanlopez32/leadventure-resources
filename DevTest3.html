      <h3>Filter Change</h3>
      <p>
        Your fleet vehicle needs to run cleanly and smoothly in order to ensure a safe, comfortable drive. One of the best ways to make sure your fleet vehicleâ€™s engine runs well is to regularly replace its filters. Oil filters and air filters must be replaced at regular intervals in order to allow your engine to run at its maximum capacity and continue to carry large, heavy loads. By setting up a maintenance schedule with the team at <strong>Up Front Automotive Service Inc.</strong>, you can make sure your filters are always replaced on time.

                            Improper alignment is a major cause of premature tire wear. Over
                            the years, a properly aligned vehicle can add thousands of miles
                            to tire life. Most tires are replaced prematurely due to adverse
                            wear.

                            Gas mileage increases as rolling resistance decreases. Total
