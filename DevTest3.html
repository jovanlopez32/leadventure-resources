            <h3>Illuminated <span>Warning Lights</span></h3>
            <p>Your vehicle’s warning lights illuminate when there is something wrong with your vehicle, including when the cylinder head and valve are faulty. Typically, it’s the warning light for engine check, low-coolant level, and over-temperature that will indicate that your cylinder head or valve needs repair or replacement. Once you see any warning light illuminate, be sure to bring your vehicle to Riverside Complete Automotive and Repair.

            <h3>Engine <span>Issues</span></h3>
            <p>Engine issues may be caused by faulty cylinder heads and valves. One of these issues is with regard to the overall performance of the engine. If you notice that your engine lacks power, the cylinder head or valve may be damaged.

In case you encounter any engine issues, the best thing to do is to bring your vehicle to Riverside Complete Automotive and Repair. This guarantees that licensed mechanics can diagnose whatever issue your vehicle may have.</p>

            <h3>Coolant and Oil <span>Leakage</span></h3>
            <p>A damaged cylinder head and valve may result in fluid loss in your vehicle. If your cylinder head is cracked, coolant may enter the combustion chamber and be burned off, resulting in your vehicle having a low-coolant level. Similarly, a busted engine valve may cause oil leakage. When there is coolant or oil leakage, white, blue, or gray smoke may be emitted from your vehicle’s tailpipe. Set up a vehicle check-up with Riverside Complete Automotive and Repair to find out whether a damaged cylinder head or valve is the cause of the issue.</p>
