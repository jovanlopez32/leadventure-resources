    Just like your engine, you should have your transmission on your import
    vehicle serviced regularly. When [ND:ClientName] in [ND:FOCUSAREA2] services
    your transmission, we:
  </p>

    <li>Clean the pan</li>

    <li>Replace old transmission fluid with new, high quality fluid</li>
    <li>Make any additional needed changes and adjustments</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Import Vehicles require the same transmission care needed by domestic
    vehicles. By replacing the old transmission fluid in your vehicle, our
    expert team at [ND:ClientName] essentially gives your vehicle’s transmission
    new life. The new fluid restores your clutch’s holding power. This reduces
    slip and heat production. Additionally, flushing the old fluid in the car
    gets rid of small bits of clutch material and metal shavings, which can
    damage your transmission by clogging passages and wedging themselves between
    moving parts. Getting rid of the old fluid reduces wear within the
    transmission and makes your car last longer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Replacing old fluid with new also provides better lubrication within the
    transmission, which boosts the holding ability of the transmission’s
    friction components. Improved lubrication also results in less heat. By
    decreasing friction and heat, your transmission will work better for a
    longer amount of time. A simple service can save you the money and time that
    come with a major transmission repair or replacement. Visit [ND:ClientName]
    in [ND:FOCUSAREA2] for your next auto repair service.
