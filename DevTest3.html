                            Improper alignment is a major cause of premature tire wear. Over
                            the years, a properly aligned vehicle can add thousands of miles
                            to tire life. Most tires are replaced prematurely due to adverse
                            wear.

                            Gas mileage increases as rolling resistance decreases. Total
                            Alignment sets all four wheels parallel, which along with proper
                            inflation, minimizes rolling resistance.
