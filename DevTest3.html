        4x4 service - Alignment
      </h3>
      <p>
        Wheel alignment (or simply alignment) is standard car maintenance that involves adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they are set to the manufacturer’s specifications. The main purpose is to let the suspension and the steering systems operate at their desired angles – this reduces tire wear. Alignment is a complicated process and not all mechanics get it right. To have experts handle your car’s alignment, visit Bob’s Premier Automotive Repair.

        4x4 service - Differentials
      </h3>
      <p>
        The differential transfers the engine power to the wheels. One important function of the differential is to pass on power to the wheels while allowing them to rotate at different speeds – thus the name differential. When turning, the outer wheels travel a larger distance than the inner wheels do (also the front wheels travel a longer distance than the rear wheels). This means that all four wheels travel at different speeds during a turn and this is where the differential comes in to help. To make sure your vehicle’s differentials are working properly, have them checked regularly. Contact Bob’s Premier Automotive Repair today for differentials examination and servicing.

        4x4 service - Driveline
      </h3>
      <p>
        A driveline is a part of your motor vehicle that connects the engine and the transmission to the wheel axles. The driveline consists of the parts of the powertrain less the engine and transmission. Failure of the driveline means that the car would not move since energy cannot be transmitted from the engine to the wheel axles. Therefore, make sure that your car’s driveline is regularly inspected and serviced. And, at Bob’s Premier Automotive Repair, you can have the driveline serviced by experts.
