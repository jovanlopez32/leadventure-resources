<h2><strong>Make Your Car Last Over 10 Years</strong></h2>
<p>
  Modern cars can last well over a decade with proper maintenance. Compared with
  the cost of purchasing a new vehicle, it pays to make car care a priority. At
  [ND:ClientName], our mission is to keep your car dependable, so you get the
  best value and mileage.
</p>
<h3><strong>Prepare for the Future - Car Maintenance Benefits</strong></h3>
<p>
  Regular maintenance costs a little in the short run but helps you retain your
  car&#39;s condition longer than motorists who don&#39;t practice automotive
  care. This comes in handy in the future when major automotive systems continue
  to operate. It also helps you prevent unexpected automotive repairs.
</p>
<p>
  Regular maintenance is also great if you ever plan to sell your car, netting
  you a better sale price than a vehicle with little maintenance.
</p>
<p>Follow the car maintenance tips below to keep your vehicle around longer.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Oil Change &amp; Automotive Fluids</strong></h2>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Change Motor Oil</strong>
</p>
<p>
  An oil change is an easy maintenance procedure that keeps engine parts
  lubricated and maintains fuel economy. Changing oil at recommended maintenance
  intervals prevents sludge build up and overheating.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >Motor oil becomes abrasive and harms metal components if never changed.
    This costs you money and overall vehicle longevity. Stick to the maintenance
    schedule and your vehicle will thank you with better mileage.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Change Brake Fluid</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Change brake fluid as directed in your owner&#39;s manual. Whenever you step
  on the brake pedal, brake fluid transfers the force to the brakes to slow or
  stop your vehicle. Recommended service intervals vary by manufacturer from
  every few years to once or twice during the life of the vehicle.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >It&#39;s possible for brake fluid to lose its effectiveness or for leaks to
    occur. If you experience abnormal brake performance, make sure to have your
    car checked.</span
  >
</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Check Coolant</strong></p>
<p>
  Coolant or antifreeze prevents overheating and freezing of the engine&#39;s
  cooling system. Like brake fluid, recommended service intervals vary by
  manufacturer and can range from roughly a few years to a recommended check
  during every scheduled maintenance service.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >Keep an eye on your coolant level to ensure there aren&#39;t any leaks. If
    you ever see the engine temperature warning light turn on, there might be
    something wrong with your coolant or the amount of coolant remaining.</span
  >
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Automotive Part Replacement</strong></h2>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Replace Brakes</strong></p>
<p>
  Brake pads and rotors need to be replaced during the life of your vehicle. The
  timing for this depends on several factors, including how often you stop while
  driving and how thin or thick the rotors and pads are initially.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >If you live in town and do a lot of stop-and-go driving, your brakes wear
    faster than someone who drives mostly on highway or country roads with few
    stops. Brake pads should be replaced when the pad has 1/4&quot;or less
    remaining.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Check Car Battery</strong>
</p>
<p>
  On average, car batteries last between 2-6 years depending on multiple
  factors, such as outdoor temperatures and driving frequency. While you
  can&#39;t control some influences, like the environment, there are ways to
  maximize battery life for your location.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >A few tips to maximize battery life: keep your battery clean; don&#39;t
    leave your car unused for an extended period of time; and don&#39;t forget
    to shut off the interior lights and headlights when your car isn&#39;t in
    use.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Replace Headlights</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Manufacturers install plastic headlights with a protective film on most modern
  vehicles. This protective film fades over time due to oxidation, turning
  headlights foggy and decreasing nighttime visibility. Oxidation is caused by
  heat, sunlight, pollution, and harsh chemicals. You can slow oxidation by
  parking in a garage when possible.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >It&#39;s recommended that you replace headlights in pairs. Assuming they
    were installed at the same time, the failure or dimness of one light means
    the other is close behind. In addition, it can be distracting having a new,
    bright headlight with an old, dim headlight.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Change Air Filters</strong>
</p>
<p>
  The <strong>engine air filter</strong> should be changed to prevent buildup of
  debris that reduces engine efficiency. Recommended air filter replacement
  intervals depend on the environment, with most lasting between 15,000 and
  30,000 miles (24,140-48,280 km).
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >Make sure to check the condition of your engine air filter every so often,
    especially if you drive in cities or dusty areas.</span
  >
</p>
<p>
  Change the <strong>cabin air filter</strong> as recommended. The cabin air
  filter keeps ventilation air clean creating a better breathing environment for
  you and your passengers. Like the engine air filter, replacement intervals
  depend how many factors. It&#39;s worth having it checked during an engine air
  filter service.
</p>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Change Oil Filters</strong>
</p>
<p>
  For an oil filter, check your owner&#39;s manual for recommended replacement
  times. Some manufacturers recommend you replace the oil filter during an oil
  change while others recommend every other oil change or other interval.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Tires &amp; Wheels</strong></h2>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span>
  <strong>Check Wheel Alignment</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Check your vehicle alignment to ensure you&#39;re getting the best life and
  performance out of your tires. You can throw a car out of alignment when you
  hit a pot hole or curb. If you notice irregular treadwear or experience your
  vehicle pulling to the left or right when you&#39;re trying to stay straight
  in a lane, you might need a wheel alignment to fix the camber, toe, and caster
  angles.
</p>
<p><span class="fa fa-check-square"></span> <strong>Rotate Tires</strong></p>
<p>
  A tire rotation maximizes tire life by swapping the position of each tire on
  your vehicle. This is because your vehicle doesn&#39;t distribute an equal
  amount of stress on each tire. By rotating front and rear tires, you keep
  treadwear even.
</p>
<p>
  <span style="color: #0156b1"
    >Rotation patterns vary depending on your vehicle and tires. Rotating tires
    regularly means you won&#39;t have to worry about finding replacements at
    different intervals or experience a performance decrease because your tires
    don&#39;t match in treadwear.</span
  >
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Driving Tips</strong></h2>
<p>
  <span class="fa fa-check-square"></span>
  <strong>Limit Stop-and-Go Driving</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Short trips waste fuel and add unnecessary wear and tear to automotive
  components. When possible, take longer routes.
</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">
  <strong>Take Care of Your Car So It Takes Care of You</strong>
</h2>
<p>
  Follow these tips and the service intervals listed inside your owner&rsquo;s
  manual to guard against major repairs and unexpected failures. Proper vehicle
  maintenance:
