                It is a real blessing to have an auto repair shop that you can depend on. That is what Bob’s is to our family! They have serviced and repaired all 4 of our cars for the last 5 years.

                I purchased a motor for my vehicle and the place I got the motor from could not install it, so they referred me to Bob’s. I had previously never been to, nor heard of, Bob’s Automotive.

                I was pleased with my first experience with Bob’s Automotive Repair. The required repair was extensive, but was explained in a precise manner and the estimate was very accurate.

                I only have one car. They are very mindful of that. They guarantee the work they do. They have been wonderful to me. It is a great relief to know that Bob’s Repair Shop is honest…
