                        <p>
                            Oil acts as a lubricant, reducing friction between the moving parts within your engine. However, over time, oil can break down and become less effective, leading to increased wear and tear on your engine. By opting for regular oil changes at Kitts Auto Service Inc, you ensure that your engine stays properly lubricated — safeguarding it from damage and extending its overall lifespan.
