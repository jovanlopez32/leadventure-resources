<h3><strong>Jack Your Ride Up High With a Lift Kit from Our Shop</strong></h3>
<p>
  When you&rsquo;re thinking about a lift, level, or drop kit, stop by and speak
  to a member of our staff. We&rsquo;ll ask you a few questions to get a feel
  for the type of kit you&rsquo;re looking for.
</p>
<p>
  One of these custom kits will give you more ground clearance, give you room
  for larger tires, or make the front level with the back. Your wish is our
  command.
</p>
<h3><strong>You&rsquo;ll Want a Suspension Lift if you Plan to:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Increase ground clearance and performance</li>
  <li>Alter steering geometry</li>
  <li>Add a more aggressive look to your truck, Jeep&reg;, or SUV</li>
</ul>
<p>
  If you just want to change your vehicle&rsquo;s look and add larger tires, a
  body lift kit will do the trick. When you buy a lift kit from Fred's Minnesota
  Wholesale Tire, it will be installed by experienced technicians.
</p>
<h3><strong>Body lift kits:</strong></h3>
<ul>
  <li>Raise the body of your truck, Jeep&reg;, or SUV off the frame</li>
  <li>
    Provide a cost-effective way to alter your vehicle without changing the
    steering and suspension geometry
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Our technicians will match your vehicle with only the ideal lift kit. We will
  never install a 6&rdquo; lift if your vehicle can only accommodate a 3&rdquo;
  lift.
</p>
<p>
  For the problem of an uneven vehicle, that is the front not being level with
  the back, a leveling kit should offer a quick fix.
