  <p><strong>Tire Pressure Monitoring System Can Saves Lives</strong></p>
  <p>
    Most people ignore their tires, yet tires are undoubtedly a critical safety component on a vehicle. Where the rubber meets the road affects traction, handling, steering, stability, and braking. Because of this, a sudden tire failure can have serious consequences, especially if it occurs when operating at high speeds.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Nearly 250,000 accidents occur in the United States per year due to low tire pressure.</li>
    <li>About 75% of roadside flats are preceded by a slow leak or under inflation.</li>
    <li>According to a recent survey, America could reduce its fuel consumption by 10% and save a collective $2 billion a year by keeping tires properly inflated.</li>
    <li>NHTSA estimates that tire pressure monitoring systems could prevent as many as 79 deaths and 10,365 injuries each year in the United States.</li>
  </ul>
  <p><strong>What is the effect of underinflation?</strong></p>
  <p>
    An estimated 23,000 accidents and 535 fatal accidents annually involve blowouts or flat tires. Maintaining proper tire air pressure is not only a major safety concern but can also affect the handling and performance of your vehicle.

  <p><strong>Why is it more expensive and time-consuming to have tires serviced rather than rotated?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Technicians use special diagnostic tools to test and recalibrate sensors any time a tire is moved from one location on the vehicle to another. A sensor must be tested to make sure it is functioning correctly and also must be reprogrammed whenever tires are moved from one position to another during rotation. OEMs recommend a sensor service kit be installed every time a tire is serviced. These kits include replacement parts to properly service the sensor. Sensors are powered by a battery that usually has a life of 6 to 8 years. The sensor has to be replaced when the battery fails because the batteries are not replaceable.
