They are designed to accommodate higher levels of inflation in order to handle varying load capacities and varying road conditions.</p> <p>Caring for your trailer tires is critical to preserve their life. The average trailer tire can be expected to last anywhere from 5,000-12,000 miles with optimal maintenance, however, this can vary. Make sure you use only the recommended inflation levels and be careful not to take your trailer to speeds greater than 65 MPH on the highway. Higher speeds are the number one cause of trailer tire failure.</p> <h2><strong>Types of Trailers Our Tires Fit</strong></h2> <div style="float: left; width: 50%;"> <ul> <li>RV Trailers</li> <li>Horse Trailers</li> <li>Boat Trailers</li> </ul> </div> <div style="float: right; width: 50%;"> <ul> <li>Motorcycle Trailers</li> <li>Camper Trailers</li> <li>Utility Trailers</li> </ul> </div> <p>Proper storage is another key component of trailer tire preservation. Tires should always be stored in a cool, dark place when they’re not in use. It is best to cover them to protect them from heat and sun damage as well. When the trailer is not being used, it is best to elevate the trailer on blocks, or use wheel chocks, to take some of the weight off of the tires. This will help prevent them from going flat.</p> <p>The knowledgeable, friendly staff here at Schrock Repair will assist you in finding the best combination of performance, durability, and cost-efficiency, no matter what type of trailer you may have.
