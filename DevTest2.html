            <h2>Most vehicle batteries need to be replaced</h2>
            <p>
                every few years, depending on the conditions in which you drive. Extreme weather, continued use of vehicle accessories and other conditions can lead to shorter battery life. Over time, your battery loses juice, and you may need to occasionally jump-start your vehicle in order to get it running. If your vehicle is showing signs of lessened battery life, such as delayed start time, you may need to get your battery replaced.
