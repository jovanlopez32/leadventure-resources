                Wheel alignment (or simply alignment) is standard car maintenance that involves adjusting the angles of the wheels so that they are set to the manufacturer's specifications. The main purpose is to let the suspension and the steering systems operate at their desired angles - this reduces tire wear. Alignment is a complicated process and not all mechanics get it right. To have experts handle your car's alignment, visit Up Front Automotive Service.

                Properly working seals provide oil and grease sealing - offering enhanced performance in a wide range of temperatures and environments. Worn out or warped seals allow external contaminants to enter the bearing unit or let lubricant escape from the unit. This ultimately leads to premature failure of the bearing unit. To keep out contamination and retain lubricant in the bearings, have the seals replaced with new ones. To have the seals replaced by experts, contact or visit Up Front Automotive Service today.

                Studs are the threaded fasteners that hold on the wheels of your truck. The wheel studs are permanently mounted on the wheel hub through the brake disk or brake drum. To secure the wheel, nuts (lug nuts) are fastened over the stud. Stripped wheel studs can be quite dangerous. Damaged wheel studs should be replaced with new ones immediately. To have your truck's wheel studs replaced with high quality ones, call <a href="tel:3307649377">(330) 764-9377</a> or visit Up Front Automotive Service today.

                A wheel nut or lug nut is a fastener for securing a wheel on the hub. A set of lug nuts are used to secure a wheel to the threaded wheel studs (which are fixed to a wheel hub). Worn out nuts means one thing - the wheel is not fixed securely on the vehicle which puts the vehicle at the risk of rolling over. To have your truck's wheels securely fastened to the hub, contact or visit Up Front Automotive Service in Medina, OH 44256 today.

            <h3 style="color: white;">Transfer Cases</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                A transfer case is a part of a four wheel drive system found in four wheel drive and all wheel drive vehicles. The transfer case receives power from the transmission and sends it to both the front and rear axles. This can be done with a set of gears, but the majority of transfer cases manufactured today are chain driven. The transfer case is connected to the transmission and also to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts. Trust the automotive experts at Up Front Automotive Service for all your transmission repairs.

            <h3 style="color: white;">Wheel Bearings</h3>
            <p style="color: white;">
                Wheel bearings are found inside of wheels, allowing the wheels to spin freely, and are connected to the brake system. They can become worn over time, causing a vibrating suspension and noisy rubbing as the car is driven. If they break completely, the vehicle will become very difficult to control and unsafe to drive. Replacement interval for wheel bearings varies greatly, but they should be checked for leaks and wear periodically. Up Front Automotive Service can make sure that your bearings are in good shape and let you know if they need replacement.
