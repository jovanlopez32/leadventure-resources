    Your vehicle’s axles are vital to keeping you safe on the road. They are just as important as other safety devices on your vehicle, such as brakes and tires. Axles bear all of your vehicle’s weight. They connect its wheels and help drive the vehicle. In most cars, the axles are an essential part of the steering system, working with power steering fluid and other components to ensure smooth turning.

    When most people think of the word axle, they imagine a bar between two wheels, as seen on wagons or train cars. Most axles, however, are more complex, and they require the eyes and expertise of someone like the team at <strong>Auto Repair Inc.</strong> to inspect and repair them.

    Most of today’s vehicles are built using split axles, which means the wheel on each side of the axle is attached to a separate shaft. Split axles allow independent suspension of the left and right wheels, which allows for a smoother ride. These modern designs also permit the left and right wheels to rotate at different speeds as the vehicle turns. By allowing each side to rotate at different speeds, the split axle improves traction and extends tire life, saving you money in the long run. This particular component is called the differential.

    The axle is connected to the wheel by a component called the CV joint. The CV joint boot is a protective flexible covering which covers the joint. If this boot becomes damaged, it can cause brake fluid to leak out, which can cause serious problems.
