    While your exhaust system helps reduce noise output from your vehicle, it also significantly reduces harmful emissions from being released into the air. When your muffler and exhaust system functions properly, it significantly reduces your vehicle’s harmful impact on the environment. It also significantly improves the functionality of your vehicle.

    Your vehicle’s exhaust system involves several components. The exhaust manifolds right behind the engine collect exhaust gases and connect to cylinder heads. Gases collected by your vehicle’s exhaust manifolds are analyzed by oxygen sensors and refined by catalytic converters before being muffled by the mufflers. By the time these gases reach the muffler, the emissions system has made your car run smoother, quieter, and cleaner.

    If any of the components of your vehicle’s exhaust system fail, your gas mileage and quality of air around you can be affected. The expert team at <strong>L & J Auto Repair Inc</strong> can inspect and repair your entire exhaust system to ensure your vehicle is running cleanly.
