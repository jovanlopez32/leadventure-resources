      Great experience every time I go. Get my car fixed here for everything. Paul is the owner he is fantastic. Goes above and beyond with a great attitude. 
      He is very fair and honest. This isn't a bought review either. I seriously have been so blessed to have them close. They have been fantastic for us. They are just Wisconsin down to earth genuine people that know vehicles. They are great.

      I have taken my cars to Eddie's for years. They look out for my safety and handle repairs proficiently. Besides that, it allows me to say hi to Paul, the owner, who consistently has a smile for all clients, which makes the mundane job of taking my car into the shop much more manageable. Thumbs up!

      Replaced the side mirror of my car at the fraction of the retailers price . It looks and works perfect. 
      They even helped the passenger door stop creaking . The overall bill came out less then originally stated . The employees are helpful and nice as well.
