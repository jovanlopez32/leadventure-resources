 <strong>Waller Tire Place</strong> was started in 1983 by Woodrow Waller Jr in an old one room school house (the former Kingsland Elementary School on Jefferson Davis Highway). With little to no financial backing and just hard work he was able to build a newer building next to the original location. It grew so rapidly in 1993 we moved to the <strong>Chester location</strong>  on 1300 W. Hundred rd. on route 10 under new owner Late Woodrow Waller Sr (Pops) the former Pastor of Straight Away church.
