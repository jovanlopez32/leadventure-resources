        <p class="generic-section-description">
            The first thing we do is come to an agreement on a price and receive a deposit to hold the RV. Then we collect the information necessary to complete the purchase. For a trade-in, we are happy to walk you through the import process. Some customers prefer to use a broker to assist with the customer's paperwork. We can help you find one so you don't feel lost as to where to look.

        <p class="generic-section-description">
            After that has been done and the sale has been finalized, you may head on down the road with your RV. We will furnish you with the title, odometer disclosure, and recall letter for you and the border office as well as all other required documentation for ownership transfer in Canada. Be sure to check if your province requires equipment such as engine block heaters, daytime running lights, etc., be sure to inform us. We are happy to help in making the modifications to your RV so it is compliant.
