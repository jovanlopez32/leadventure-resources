  Your vehicle can last for well over a decade with proper maintenance and
  repairs. Compared with the cost of purchasing a new vehicle, it pays to take
  good care of your car. Preventative maintenance will help you retain your
  car&#39;s condition longer, and it also helps you prevent unexpected
  automotive repairs. Regularly scheduled maintenance and lubrication using the
  manufacturer&rsquo;s recommended intervals is the best way to proactively take
  care of your vehicle. Replacing normal wear-and-tear parts before they break
  is also a good path to follow on the road to long vehicle life.

<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Keep an Eye on Fluids and Filters</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your car&rsquo;s engine is full of sensitive and delicate moving parts that
    rely on fluids like oil, transmission fluid, and coolant to function well.
    If you don&rsquo;t keep an eye on these fluid levels or periodically change
    its filters, these delicate parts could face irreparable damage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Your car&rsquo;s brakes also require brake fluid to transfers the force to
    the brakes to slow or stop your vehicle. It&#39;s possible for brake fluid
    to lose its effectiveness or for leaks to occur. If you experience abnormal
    brake performance, make sure to have your car checked.
  </li>
  <li>
    Coolant or antifreeze prevents overheating and freezing of the engine&#39;s
    cooling system. Like brake fluid, recommended service intervals vary by
    manufacturer and can range from roughly a few years to a recommended check
    during every scheduled maintenance service. Keep an eye on your coolant
    level to ensure there aren&#39;t any leaks. If you ever see the engine
    temperature warning light turn on, there might be something wrong with your
    coolant or the amount of coolant remaining.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Automotive Part Replacement</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Your vehicle&rsquo;s brakes should be examined at least once a year to
    identify any wear and tear and need for repair. Brake pads and rotors
    typically last anywhere from 35,000 to 60, 000 miles depending on how often
    you stop while driving and how thin or thick the rotors and pads are
    initially
  </li>
  <li>
    Your car&rsquo;s battery typically lasts 4-5 years, depending on outdoor
    temperature, driving frequency, and overall use among other influences. To
    maximize battery life, keep your battery clean; don&#39;t leave your car
    unused for an extended period, and don&#39;t forget to shut off the interior
    lights and headlights when your car isn&#39;t in use.
  </li>
  <li>
    Driving with bad headlights can be very dangerous. Restoring your headlights
    can have it looking like new and can shine up to 3.4x lighter when driving.
    You can slow oxidation caused by heat, sunlight, pollution, and harsh
    chemicals by parking in a garage when possible.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 class="subtitle"><strong>Tires and Wheels</strong></h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    A car&rsquo;s wheels and tires are essential to the safety and performance
    of your vehicle. Inspect your tires and wheels regularly for symptoms such
    as low inflation pressure, uneven wear patterns, or excessive wear. You
    should also take time to keep them at the proper pressure for better fuel
    economy.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tire services such as a tire rotation, wheel alignment, tire balancing, and
    tire repair can help maximize tire life and improve your safety. Your
    vehicle&rsquo;s owner&rsquo;s manual will provide a schedule for the
    recommended time to perform tire services.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  By following these tips and the service intervals listed inside your
  owner&rsquo;s manual, you can protect your vehicle from major repairs and
  unexpected failures. Proper vehicle maintenance can save you money in the long
  run and improve your safety and the safety of your passengers. Stay on top of
  routine vehicle maintenance and visit at [ND:ClientName] in [ND:FocusArea1]
  when your vehicle needs to be serviced by our experienced mechanics.
