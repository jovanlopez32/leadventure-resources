# Observations for the UI Design Team

## File Management
- Make sure the final version uploaded to SharePoint matches the version in Salesforce
- Update XD files when "unretouch" content arrives and notify when files are modified
- Include subpage images in the XD file to improve compression and retrieval

## Text and Typography
- Avoid inner shadows on text (use outer shadows if needed)
- Consider text length (use content libraries when appropriate)
- Check text grammar
- Label fonts and specify which icon library is used

## Images and Graphics
- Images with irregular shapes should not include movement or zoom
- Include the corresponding color layer in images
- Check image cropping before uploading mockups
- For CTAs, create masks with the desired shape to properly separate the image

## Layer Management
- Apply transparency directly to each image (not as floating elements)
- Design overlapping effects considering that backgrounds should be in a back layer
- Check proper layer alignment and size

## Responsive Design
- Avoid overlapping geometric shapes (not good for responsive format)
- Create components that adapt well to responsive design
- Avoid excessive background and polygon overlays (affects accessibility)

## Workflow
- Check the Design System for elements like tires, coupons, and financing
- Verify that mobile versions download correctly
- Consider implementation time when designing complex animations

# List 2: Discussion Points for the UI Design Team

## File Management
- Consistency between SharePoint version and Salesforce version
- Notification and update of XD files when receiving "unretouch" content
- Including subpage images in XD files for resource optimization

## Text and Typography
- Technical limitations of inner shadows on text versus outer shadows
- Considerations about text length and content library usage
- Grammar checking as part of the design process
- Standardization in font and icon library labeling

## Images and Graphics
- Behavior of images with irregular shapes related to animations and zoom
- Including color layers in images from creation
- Mockup cropping verification process before delivery
- Masking techniques for CTAs with custom shapes

## Layer Management
- Applying transparency directly to images versus floating elements
- Proper layering of overlapping effects and backgrounds
- Layer alignment and sizing in final design

## Responsive Design
- Impact of overlapping geometric shapes on adaptability
- Component adaptability on different screen sizes
- Effect of excessive overlays on site accessibility

## Workflow
- Following the Design System for recurring elements
- Mobile version compatibility in the download process
- Balance between animation complexity and implementation times
