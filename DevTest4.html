        <h2>THE BENEFITS OF A PROPERLY MAINTAINED EXHAUST</h2>
        <p>While your exhaust system helps reduce noise output from your vehicle, it also significantly reduces harmful emissions from being released into the air. When your vehicle’s muffler and exhaust system functions properly, it significantly reduces your car’s harmful impact on the environment. It also significantly improves the functionality of your vehicle.</p>

        <h2>YOUR VEHICLE’S EXHAUST SYSTEM INVOLVES SEVERAL COMPONENTS</h2>
        <p>The exhaust manifolds right behind the engine collect exhaust gases and connect to cylinder heads. Gases collected by your vehicle’s exhaust manifolds are analyzed by oxygen sensors and refined by catalytic converters before being muffled by the mufflers. By the time these gases reach the muffler, the emissions system has made your car run smoother, quieter and cleaner.</p>
