            <h3>Wheel Bearings</h3>
            <p>
                Wheel bearings are found inside of wheels, allowing the wheels to spin freely, and are connected to the brake system. They can become worn over time, causing a vibrating suspension and noisy rubbing as the car is driven. If they break completely, the vehicle will become very difficult to control and unsafe to drive. Replacement interval for wheel bearings varies greatly, but they should be checked for leaks and wear periodically. Bob’s Premier Automotive Repair can make sure that your bearings are in good shape and let you know if they need replacement.
