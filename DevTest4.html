            <p>
                The expert team at <strong>Up Front Automotive Service Inc</strong> essentially gives your vehicle’s transmission new life. The new fluid restores your clutch’s holding power. This reduces slip and heat production. Additionally, flushing the old fluid gets rid of small bits of clutch material and metal shavings, which can damage your transmission by clogging passages and wedging themselves between moving parts. Getting rid of the old fluid reduces wear within the transmission.

                Also provides better lubrication within the transmission, which boosts the holding ability of the transmission’s friction components. Improved lubrication also results in less heat. By decreasing friction and heat, your transmission will work better for a longer amount of time. A simple service can save you the money and time that come with a major transmission repair or replacement.
