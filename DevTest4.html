    Find the right lift kit for your Jeep or truck. Raising the body of your
    vehicle provides great benefits, including:

  <ul>
    <li>
      Extra ground clearance for the biggest and baddest off-road tires and
      wheels
    </li>
    <li>Less body exposure to sharp rocks</li>
    <li>
      Aggressive and distinct appearance that towers above other vehicles on the
      road
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Lowering the suspension can provide performance benefits depending on your
    vehicle and how low you take it. The potential benefits of a lowered vehicle
    include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Reduced risk of rollovers due to a lower center of gravity</li>
    <li>Improved handling and greater tire grip on some vehicles</li>
    <li>Less wind drag due to greater aerodynamics</li>
    <li>
      Street appeal & custom look that sets your vehicle apart from stock models
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Before installing a lowering kit, talk with the service staff at
    [ND:ClientName]. Not all vehicles experience the same benefits from a
    lowered suspension. That's why it's important to choose an automotive
    service center with knowledgeable technicians who understand the pros and
    cons of lowering kits. We can discuss the advantages for your vehicle make
    and model.
