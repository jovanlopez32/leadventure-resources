    <h3>Types of Custom Wheels</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Alloy Wheels:</strong> Alloy wheel is made with more than one
        metal and is lighter than the steel wheel because most alloy wheels are
        made with aluminum. It is lightweight and strong, to improve
        performance, handling, and gas mileage.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chrome Wheels:</strong> Chrome wheels are wheels that has a
        chrome coating finish on it. This helps to reduce the chance of your
        wheel becoming oxidized. Rather than being entirely composed of chrome,
        the surface of the wheel is instead lightly coated in chrome.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Custom Steel Wheels:</strong> Heavier than aluminum, these
        wheels are perfect for off-road driving and heavy-duty work. These
        strong wheels improve vehicle stability and are inexpensive and function
        great as a standard wheel.
      </li>
