                Transfer Cases
            </h3>
            <p>
                A transfer case is a part of a four wheel drive system found in four wheel drive and all wheel drive vehicles. The transfer case receives power from the transmission and sends it to both the front and rear axles. This can be done with a set of gears, but the majority of transfer cases manufactured today are chain driven. The transfer case is connected to the transmission and also to the front and rear axles by means of drive shafts. Trust the automotive experts at Bob’s Premier Automotive Repair for all your transmission repairs.
