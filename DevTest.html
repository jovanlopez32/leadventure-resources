    <p><strong>Follow the car care tips below to keep your vehicle running reliably:

    </strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Change the oil within the suggested service intervals. This helps your engine and vehicle run smoothly and can improve gas mileage by 1-2%.</li>
        <li>Check and lubricate moving components regularly, such as CV and u-joints, to prevent breakdowns.</li>
        <li>Check transmission and differential fluid regularly. Unusual noises, sluggish shifting, or abrupt gear changes are signs that your transmission service interval is approaching or has passed.</li>
        <li>Pay attention to battery life. Keep battery connections tight, clean, and free of corrosion. Replace batteries as necessary.</li>
        <li>Change brake fluid once a year to keep components in top operating condition.</li>
        <li>Check other important fluids like power steering fluid and coolant on a regular basis. Each fluid has its own service interval.</li>
        <li>Flush and fill the coolant system to rid it of dirt and rust. Check refrigerant prior to warmer seasons.</li>
        <li>Get wheel alignments to realign your wheels to manufacturer specifications. This improves straight-line tracking and reduces tire wear.</li>
        <li>Avoid stop-and-go driving to save fuel and prevent unnecessary wear and premature aging of components.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By following these tips and the service intervals listed inside your owner’s manual, you can guard against major repairs and unexpected failures. Proper vehicle maintenance can save you money in the long run, and improve your safety and the safety of your passengers, while neglecting suggested services at regular intervals will void vehicle and parts warranties.
