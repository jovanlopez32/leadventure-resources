    <h2>Emissions, Exhaust & State Inspection</h2>
    <p>
      The quality of the gasoline you put into your vehicle can vary greatly. When the gasoline is of poor quality, it can cause deposit buildup. Modern vehicles—especially those with gasoline direct injection—are particularly sensitive to deposits that build up in fuel injectors, intake valves and ports. Using specialized equipment, our technicians will quickly and effectively clean the intake manifold, ports, intake valves and combustion chamber and install injector cleaning additives in your vehicle’s tank. This service will restore lost power and performance and will reduce harmful exhaust emissions.
