            <h2>The best way to prevent long-term and costly problems with your vehicle</h2>
            <p>
                is to keep up with its <a href="https://burtbrothers.com/blog/preventive-maintenance-for-your-car/" target="_blank">preventative maintenance</a> schedule. One major key to successfully making sure you are doing all you need to do is to read your vehicle’s owner’s manual. Regardless of your vehicle’s make or model, its owner’s manual will contain a maintenance schedule. Every make and model is different, and standby beliefs such as “You have to change your oil every 3,000 miles,” may not apply to your car.
