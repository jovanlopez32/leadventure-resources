  <p><strong>How often should I rotate my tires?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Your tires should be rotated every other oil change or every 5,000 miles.
    Neglecting to rotate tires is a major cause of premature tire wear.

      >Is it really necessary to replace my timing belt at the manufacturer’s
      recommended interval?</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    YES. The failure of a timing belt in many cars can result in major engine
    damage. The cost of repairing an engine with a broken timing belt is much
    greater than the cost of a timing belt replacement.

      >What does it mean if my “check engine” or “service engine soon” light
      comes on?</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many sensors and computerized components that manage your
    vehicle’s engine performance and emissions. When one of these fails, the
    “check engine” light is illuminated. Although your car may seem to run fine,
    it is important to have the issue addressed to prevent long-term problems or
    failure of emission tests.

  <p><strong>What should I do if my car starts to overheat?</strong></p>
  <p>
    This is a very serious problem – if your car overheats for too long, you can
    damage your engine. As soon as possible, find a safe place to pull off the
    road and shut off the engine! Do not attempt to check the fluid level in the
    radiator as it can burn you. The best thing to do is have your car towed to
    a repair shop.
  </p>
  <p><strong>When should I get my oil changed?</strong></p>
  <p>
    You should get your oil changed every 3,000 miles or as recommended in your
    vehicle’s owner’s manual. If intervals are extended, ensure you use oil that
    is capable of extended mileage changes.

  <p><strong>What causes milky brown engine oil?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Milky brown engine oil is an indication of coolant in the oil. This can be
    caused by a blown head gasket (other gasket), a failed transmission cooler
    or cracked casings. This condition is very serious and needs to be checked
    by a professional technician quickly.

      >How to make sure my car battery has a good electrical connection?</strong
    >
  </p>
  <p>
    Battery cables and terminals should be cleaned and inspected to make sure
    they provide a good electrical connection.

  <p><strong>What is synthetic motor oil?</strong></p>
  <p>
    Synthetic motor oils can be a good choice for high output, turbocharged or
    supercharged engines, vehicles that are used for towing (especially during
    hot weather) or vehicles that are operated in extremely cold or hot
    climates. Synthetic motor oils, though several times more expensive than
    mineral-based motor oils, can improve fuel economy and provide longer
    intervals between changes. They also provide instant lubrication on
    start-up.

  <p><strong>When should I replace my car’s fuel filter?</strong></p>
  <p>
    To help ensure dependable, trouble-free performance, replace your car’s fuel
    filter approximately every 30,000 miles or as recommended in your vehicle’s
    owner’s manual.
  </p>
  <p><strong>When should I change my spark plugs?</strong></p>
  <p>
    For maximum fuel economy and peak engine performance, your spark plugs
    should be replaced every 30 months or 30,000 miles, unless your vehicle is
    equipped with 100,000-mile platinum-tipped spark plugs.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>What should I do when I need to replace a burned out fuse?</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    Always replace burned-out fuses with ones of the same amperage (printed on
    the fuse) and note that if a fuse continues to “blow,” you should have the
    circuit checked professionally by one of our technicians for defects.
