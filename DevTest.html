                Your vehicle’s battery is the source of electrical currents necessary to start the engine. The battery provides power to your vehicle’s accessories and electrical parts; it allows them to operate even when your vehicle’s engine is not running. Additionally, components such as your engine and starter rely on the battery for power; they cannot run without a properly functioning battery. Your battery is your vehicle’s voltage stabilizer for the entire electrical system.
