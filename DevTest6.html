        <h4><strong>Stalling</strong></h4>
        <p>
            When your engine stops running and your cars stalls, this could indicate a problem with the electrical system in your car or the fuel system. The engine is unable to ignite the gas in the car’s cylinders and requires attention from a certified technician.

        <h4><strong>Engine Clicking or Ticking</strong></h4>
        <p>
            If your engine starts to sound like your watch, you may be having a problem with the car’s oil pressure. A damaged or clogged oil pump could be preventing oil from reaching all of the components necessary to run the vehicle.
