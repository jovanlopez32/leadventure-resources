            <p>

                <h3>Check Engine Light Turns On</h3>
                <p>
                    A check engine light indicates a serious problem with your ignition, fuel or emission system. If this light comes on, it is a serious problem and needs immediate attention.

                <p>
                    When your engine stops running and your car stalls, this could indicate a problem with the electrical system in your car or the fuel system. The engine is unable to ignite the gas in the car’s cylinders and requires attention from a certified technician.

                <p>
                    If your engine starts to sound like your watch, you may be having a problem with the car’s oil pressure. A damaged or clogged oil pump could be preventing oil from reaching all of the components necessary to run the vehicle.
