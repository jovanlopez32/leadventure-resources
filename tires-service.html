  <p><strong>Tire Guide and Tips: Understanding your Tires</strong></p>
  <p>For example, the number may read P225/70-R15, 89H:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>P = Passenger Tire (LT = Light Truck)</li>
    <li>225 = Overall width of the tire in millimeters</li>
    <li>
      70 = Sidewall height (distance from rim to tread) as a percentage of the
      tread width (known as aspect ratio)
    </li>
    <li>
      R = Tire construction, this one is Radial (also, B = Belted Bias, D =
      Diagonal Bias
    </li>
    <li>15 = Represents the size of the wheel in inches</li>
    <li>
      89H = Weight capacity of the tire (this may not be present in all cases)
    </li>
    <li>
      Speed rating is sometimes put in front of the R (or B or D). A straight R
      rating means that it is rated for speeds of up to 100mph. Other speed
      ratings are: S=112mph, T=118mph, U=124mph, H=130mph, V=149mph, & a Z rated
      tire is for speeds in excess of 149mph.
    </li>
    <li>
      A V and Z rated tires have excellent dry pavement grip/traction but due to
      their soft rubber compounds, do not have a long life.
    </li>
    <li>
      A tread rating indicates how long a tire should last. This figure is
      written in small letters on the sidewall of your tire. The higher the
      number, the longer the tire should last. 100 is the basic tread wear
      rating.
    </li>
    <li>
      The traction rating works just like grading – ‘A’ being the best, ‘B’ is
      good, and ‘C’ is acceptable. This number is also found on the sidewall.
    </li>
    <li>
      Temperature ratings work the same – ‘A’ best, ‘B’ good, ‘C’ acceptable. If
      you drive your car very hard, you want a temperature rating of ‘A’ because
      a ‘C’ would fail faster under these conditions. Again, look for this
      number on the sidewall.
    </li>
  </ul>
