# Team Meeting Notes - Website Development Process

Hello everyone, I hope you are all doing well. I would like to start by asking you, what are the steps or the process for building a website?

I remember there are 3 steps: first the landing page, then the content migration, and lastly the blog migration. Is that correct? So are there 4 steps?

Did you already have the training?

If you already had the training, maybe we can identify 1 or 2 developers to handle the content migration for the sites, similar to what they have on the blog. Maybe we could test this small change for one week — like sending half the builds earlier — and see the results.

As I mentioned before and by message, I rely a lot on the data from the Salesforce platform to identify which aspects the developers can improve.

Another thing we discussed was creating a component library. I haven't met with Juan yet to see if they have something similar in Spark, but you can start working on it.

Start creating your component library with the collaboration of the developers. [Give an example of the carousel we are working on to integrate it into the documentation. And show the Netdriven documentation.]

Maybe create a file to check the sites internally, like a checklist. This helps us identify which aspects each developer can improve. For example, if we see in our reviews that a developer has difficulty with something like checking or linking the CTAs correctly, this helps us improve the process for that developer.

This is more for onboarding, but it also helps to create a step-by-step guide of how the process works. Or in these cases, a step-by-step guide for the processes that are more complicated to complete. For example, how to activate and configure the blogs correctly.

It is also very useful for us to use browser extensions that make our work easier. Most of the time the design document is enough, but sometimes it's not, so I'm sharing 3 extensions that can be useful:

**Clear Cache Extension**  
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/clear-cache/cppjkneekbjaeellbfkmgnhonkkjfpdn  
This extension helps us clear the browser cache more quickly.

**Fake Filler Extension**  
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/fake-filler/bnjjngeaknajbdcgpfkgnonkmififhfo  
This extension helps us test forms more quickly.

**ColorZilla Extension**  
https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp  
This extension helps us identify page colors more quickly. This is useful in cases where the design doesn't include some colors or they are difficult to identify.

**Simple Mass Downloader Extension**

This last extension helps us download files from a website in bulk.

Finally, what could help us and what I want to implement in the projects we are currently working on is to use an IDE with AI. The one I have tested is Windsurf since it has a free version that we can take advantage of. As you can see, the editor helps us code faster by completing or giving code suggestions.

I will send you this link where we can request access to these tools. We would just need to verify what the process is to request this access for your project.

I just hope these ideas and tools can make things a little smoother.
